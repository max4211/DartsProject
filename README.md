# DartsProject
The goal of this project is to get more experience with iOS development as well as streamline the darts games in my apartment.

## Problem
Prior to this app, my room mates played a lot of darts in our apartment and kept the scores on paper. However, this was very tedious. I decided to create an iOS app to track scores throughout the game.

## Goals
The main goal of this repository is gain experience with iOS development, and to make our dart games more eco friendly.

### Steps

1. Secure a Mac for development
